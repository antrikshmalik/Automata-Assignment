# Automata-Assignment
This is the automata assignment for the team named HelmHoltz. The assignment topic was "***Equivalence of two DFAs"*** . The code is in the file named "assignment.py".

**Requirements**

 1. Python SDK installed on your local machine.
 2. Numpy installed on the machine

**Procedure to run**
 1. Open the terminal
 2. `pip install numpy`
 3. `cd "path to assignment.py"`
 4. `python assignment.py`
 5. input as guided

**Note**
Please run on local machine only, since running on notebooks like Google Colab or Anaconda results in abnormal kernel behavior when error in automata input occurs. This is due to the use of `sys.exit()` which results in the restarting of the kernel and interrupting the flow of the program.
